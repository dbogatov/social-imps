	<h2>Freedom of Speech</h2>

		<hr />

		<p>
			Journalist Alec Lui described BitCoin as, "a compelling, if not polarizing mix of freedom of speech, cryptography, networked computing, finance, economics, and even politics. And one year after the bubble popped, the cryptocurrency is, against all odds, alive and well. In fact, its price has finally stabilized [1]".

			The First Amendment provides a constitutional right to free speech. In 1995, in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that the First Amendment protects anonymous speakers, which means it is likely covers anonymous online speech too [2].

		<h3>Freedom of Speech Conflicts</h3>

			<p>
				Problems may arise when the government moves toward regulating various aspects of Bitcoin. Governments will establish, "new e-discovery rules targeting users who have taken advantage of Bitcoin's anonymity to commit illegal acts" [2].

			<p>
				A initial problem is  issuing a subpoena. When determining the initial threshold for the government to issue a subpoena, the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress has to take some restrictions into consideration. For example, the government should not able able to subpoena a website or Bitcoin wallet service to gain information about an unlimited number of transactions [2]. This prevents governmental overstep and potential infringement upon the First Amendment rights of legitimate Bitcoin users" [2]. There is a disconnect in the  e-discovery rules for criminal litigation, and the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress must design a balance, "that fits between the tests for granting subpoenas duces tecum and grand jury subpoenas" [2].
