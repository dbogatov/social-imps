	<h2>Errors, Failures, Risks</h2>

		<hr />

			<p>
				Here we look at a few risks that surround the usage of Bitcoin.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Regulatory</strong> risk. A lack of properly laid out regulation surrounding Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies means that their future is very uncertain in the context of our society. Bitcoin currently has an ambiguous legal status and has been treated as both currency and commodity. A big question that has arisen is how it should be taxed, with varying approaches in different legal systems across the globe. In the U.S., the IRS decided that Bitcoins should be treated as property for tax purposes. The rules and regulations surrounding bitcoins will probably see several changes this uncertainty is what gives the currency risk. Governments want to make sure that those dealing with bitcoins operate within existing laws. [1] [2]

				In 2013, the government seized funds for the famous Bitcoin exchange as Mt. Gox, as a resulting of their not complying with rules set forward for businesses. [3] Another case where a government agency stepped in was that of Bitcoin Savings and Trust, which in July 2013 was exposed as a Ponzi scheme. Promising 7% weekly returns, the organization was able to trick hundreds of customers of Bitcoins. The SEC charged the trust's founder, Trendon T. Shavers with running the scheme. Shavers stole an estimated 193,000 BTC, which in today's value would be worth more than $11 million. [4]

				<strong>Security</strong> risk. Bitcoin was built to provide a much safer and open system than those for original fiat currencies. While it has been proven that the current system is not foolproof, even more concerning is the fact that most owners of bitcoin utilize a growing eco-system of third-party intermediaries supporting bitcoin transactions. These include currency exchanges, wallets, mining pools, and investment services. Most of the risk coin holders face is in dealing with these intermediaries, which act as centralized authorities, something the bitcoin technology originally was supposed to address. When the intermediaries fail or are exploited, the users have nothing protecting their losses. [5] [6] [7]
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the more substantial failures in this sense happened in 2011, when one of the earlier wallet services, MyBitcoin, shut down after reportedly having 51% of its bitcoins stolen. This amounted to nearly 79,000 BTC, which in today's value is more than $43 million. It's worth noting that even though this was announced as a hack, it could have been a scam. [8]
			</p>

			<p>
				Bitcoin is highly <strong>volatile</strong>, making it a very risky investment vehicle or currency to use in the same way that our normal fiat currencies are used. News on Bitcoin often have drastic effects on its price and the price of bitcoin has repeatedly dropped by more than 10% in a few days, meaning that with a significant amount of personal wealth can be lost in a matter of hours. [1] [9]
			</p>

			<p>
				Bitcoin transaction are, compared to fiat currencies, more risky in that they are <strong>irreversible</strong>. Most payment systems today have means by which a transaction can be voided in the case of errors or mistakes, but bitcoin transaction are irreversible. In order to get money back, the receiver needs to send the money by himself. Some Bitcoin critics, like Nicholas Weaver, writer for Wired, argue that this gets in the way of Bitcoin replacing normal currencies. Irreversibility means that you can only detect fraud, but you can never undo it, without adding some layer of logic on top of how it currently works. [10]
